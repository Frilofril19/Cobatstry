# Cobatstry
Cobatstry is a mod that expands Mindustry with a brand new campaign. It inherits many features from the original planets while introducing its own unique mechanics.

## Balance & Strategy
On the planet Fralion, you’ll face a rebalanced set of enemy units and turrets. All enemies fall into several categories:
- Fast
- Slow
- Close-range
- Long-range
- High HP
- Low HP
- High burst damage
- High DPS
- Low burst damage
- Low DPS

Units are designed based on these characteristics, and sometimes a Tier 1 unit can outperform a Tier 3 unit under certain conditions. Understanding enemy types and their weaknesses is essential to building effective turret defenses.
Turrets are also classified to suit different combat situations:
- Anti-boss
- Anti-swarm (many small units)
- Anti-midline (regular units)
- Anti-air
- Anti-ground
- Universal
- Long-range
- Short-range
- High rate of fire
- Low rate of fire

This system encourages strategic turret placement instead of simply using the strongest ones.

## New Mechanics
#### Flag
![flagImg](sprites/blocks/effect/flag.png)

A new, expensive and slow-to-build block that increases your maximum unit cap by +1. Unlike cores, it provides unit capacity, enabling players to build limitless armies. However, units are not overpowered — victory comes through numbers and strategy, not brute strength.

#### Modules

Small cores that are placed in module zones around the main core in each sector. They expand the core’s functionality, especially the storage system.
By holding Ctrl and hovering over a module, you can choose your new primary unit — the one you’ll play as. You can switch this at any time.
Each module also has its own drone for specific tasks, such as:
- Construction
- Resource mining
- Sector capture
