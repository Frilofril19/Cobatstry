# Cobatstry
Cobatstry is a mod that expands Mindustry with a brand new campaign. It inherits many features from the original planets while introducing its own unique mechanics.

## Balance & Strategy
Sometimes a Tier 1 unit can outperform a Tier 3 unit under certain conditions. Understanding enemy types and their weaknesses is essential to building effective turret defenses.
And turrets have a number of characteristics by which they can be distributed and defenses can be assembled based on them:
- Anti-boss
- Anti-swarm (many small units)
- Anti-midline (regular units)
- Anti-air
- Anti-ground
- Universal
- Long-range
- Short-range

## New Mechanics
#### Flags

A new, expensive and slow-to-build blocks that increases your maximum unit cap by +1 (+2 or +3). Unlike cores, it provides unit capacity, enabling players to build limitless armies. However, units are not overpowered — victory comes through numbers and strategy, not brute strength.

#### Modules

Small cores that are placed in module zones around the main core in each sector. They expand the core’s functionality, especially the storage system.
By holding Ctrl and hovering over a module, you can choose your new primary unit — the one you’ll play as. You can switch this at any time.
Each module also has its own drone for specific tasks, such as:
- Construction
- Resource mining
- Sector capture
